# MuseumRoomFinder
A route drawing guide that my classmate and I designed and implemented together.

When you click on the "Display Artworks" button on the interface that appears when you run the application, you will see a list of which works are in which rooms. If you enter the code of the room where the work you want to go to is "R<number>" (for example "R102"), the application will directly draw a route on how to reach that work. If the room is on your current floor, you will see that a path has been drawn directly there; if it is on a higher floor, you will see that a path has been drawn first to the stairs and then to the room.

The list of works was kept using Linked List, and the rooms were kept using Binary Search Tree algorithms.
